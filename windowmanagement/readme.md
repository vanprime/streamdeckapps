# Idea
Window management on mac is hard so I decided to add some scripts that position windows like I enjoy them when working in different scenarios.

# Usage

SetSceneForDaily.applescript positions the current chrome window to the right meet to the left (have fun adjusting that to MS Teams ðŸ™ƒ).
SetFrontAppLeft/RightDynamic.applescript sets the currently active window to either of those spots. For some electron apps (VSCode, Teams) that doesnt work since the app can't be found. IDK why and I don't bother.
